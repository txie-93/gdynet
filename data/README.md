# MD trajectory data

The MD trajectory data used in the paper can be downloaded from the following repository.

https://doi.org/10.24435/materialscloud:2019.0017/v1

It contains the MD trajectories of three material systems, which are in a format that can be directly inputted to `preprocess.py`.

- Toy system of a Li atom in a face-centered cubic lattice of sulfur atoms.
- Solid-liquid interface of a Si-Au binary system.
- Polymer electrolyte of Li-ion battery made of PEO/LiTFSI. 

It also contains the preprocessed data of the toy system, which have been split into three parts for training, validation, and testing. These files can be directly inputted to `main.py`.
